                    Following her rescue from the devastating Quarter Quell, Katniss awakes in the supposedly destroyed District 13. Her home, District 12, has been reduced to rubble, and Peeta is now a brainwashed captive of President Snow. At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panemâ€”a rebellion that will place her at the center of a plot to turn the tables on Snow. <br> <br> Realizing the stakes are no longer just for survival, Katniss teams up with her closest friends for the ultimate mission. Together, they leave District 13 to liberate the citizens of Panem and assassinate President Snow, who's obsessed with destroying Katniss. What lies ahead are mortal traps, dangerous enemies and moral choices that will ultimately determine the future of millions.

However, President Snow proves that he is still very much in control when word comes of a cruel change in the rules for the upcoming 75th Hunger Games.

            		In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. <br> <br> Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.
